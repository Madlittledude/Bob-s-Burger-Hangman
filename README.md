This is my best attempt at the game. I found an online version of a similar game and I did my best to incorprate what I recently learned. 
This bootcamp assignment was given to me at a very unfortunate time that conlficted with my school work and finals. Upon my return to Milwaukee, I started to complete all of my school work that I could not do at home in Los Angeles. This grind did not end for over a week and a half straight. In fact, this assignment was the last thing for me before I could relax from finishing the semester. I'm exhausted and have been up for the last 3 days without sleep. I really wanted to do well on this assignment, but I needed to prioritize my schoolwork. I hope that I can still be considered for the position. I am taking it upon myself to continue learning how to code, as I uderstand it's utility to a far greater degree than before. I wanted to do well, but I had far too many deadlines to meet this week.
